# Instructions For Re-Running This Code

The graphs generated here will be written out to the presentation_graphs folder. Therefore, in order to change the graphs for the presentation slides, we will change the code in this folder, and then re-run the notebooks. This is to prevent us from constantly re-running the notebooks and manually saving the images to the presentation_graphs file. Because we all have the data saved in different locations, the file path_to_data.py will consist of the local path. Update that file to match your own data location if you need to run any of the notebooks.
