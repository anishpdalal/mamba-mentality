# Project Description

For our final project, we wanted to create a machine learning algorithm that could predict Kobe Bryant's shot success. Using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/data), we were able to create an algorithm with an accuracy of <INSERT ACCURACY HERE>.

Please use the labeled folders in this repository to find our code for our expoloratory data analysis, fitting multiple models, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization of our data.
